# SEI Project 1

The purpose of this project is to display the skills I have attained from the first unit in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. 

## Description

Having recently finished a large marathon of Marvel Movie watching at the time I thought this would be a great way for me to display not only my love for Marvel but also my love for programming. 

Having not yet learned anything about backend, trying to figure out how to get the single page to feel as though it had multiple pages seemed difficult at the time. Turns out it was actually quite simple, with a bit of creative thought and ALOT of DOM manipulation anytime you click a button to another page, the JavaScript will clear the html of the body leaving only the nav bar and rebuild the page from the ground up. 

## Getting Started

This project doesn't use anything other than vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS. 
Use the following command in your terminal to clone down a copy for yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/Jexxer/sei-project1.git
```

### Dependencies

* There are no dependencies as of yet. Just plug and play.


### Executing program

* I recomend using VScode or another similar to run a live server.
* Without Live Server just navigate to the download directory and open the index.html with your favorite browser.
